    "The chemical kinetics model with enzymatic reactions presents a case of averages. We tend to forget that chemical reactions are actually about forming or breaking bonds between particles like ions and molecules. Usual kinetic laws like the law of mass action or the Michaelis-Menten formulation represent an approximation over a large number of such particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We probably learnt in high-school physics that the pressure of a gas is the result of lots of gas molecules bumping against the wall of the container, and its temperature is related to the kinetic energy of the molecules. In a solution also, the ions or molecules bounce around under thermal motion. Unless there is specific molecular machinery providing directed force, they move under Brownian motion. When by chance, two reactant particles hit one another, they may undergo chemical interaction. Thus, at the scale of a small number of particles, chemical reactions are discrete random events, rather than the continuous changes we see in a beaker in the chemistry lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the biological cell, and especially in small compartmentalized volumes like the neuronal spine, the number of reacting molecules, ions, etc., can be so small that the randomness of the chemical interaction can render the macroscopic chemical laws inaccurate. Another word for this randomness is *stochasticity* and such random processes are called *stochastic process*.\n",

Try re-plotting only a small duration of a single `Pool` to zoom into the numbers (or use `plt.xlim(xmin, xmax)` and `plt.ylim(ymin, ymax)` to define the limits of the plot window)."
