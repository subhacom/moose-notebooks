    "## Simulating Hodgkin and Huxleys experiment with different voltage steps\n",
    "Hodgkin and Huxley first identified the properties of the $K^{+}$ conductance by stepping the command voltage to various values (6, 10, 19, 26, 32, 38, 51, 63, 76, 88, 100, 109 mV above resting value). To do this we can repeat the simulation by changing the command voltage in our voltage clamp, and accumulating the time series of GK. We already defined the function `set_command_time_course(command, base, delay, level)` which we can use in a loop to update the level and rerun the simulation."
