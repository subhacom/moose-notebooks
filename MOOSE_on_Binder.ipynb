    "[binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a free online service for running jupyter notebooks. Every notebook in this repository has a binder button on top like this:  [![Binder](./binder_logo.png)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MooseNeuro/moose-notebooks/HEAD?labpath=MOOSE_on_Binder.ipynb).\n",

Like your desktop version of JupyterLab, you will see a list of files and folders on the left pane, and you can double click any file to open it in the editor pane. If it is a Jupyter notebook file (filename extension `.ipynb`), you can run the code cells in the usual manner.\n",
