    "# Bistability using a chemical model\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This is based on the simple bistables example by Upi Bhalla, available as a script in moose-examples/tutorials/ChemicalBistables/simpleBis.py.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can build bistable systems using a set of chemical reactions. What is a bistable system? Think of a light switch. It can be either on or off. If you turn it on, it stays on. It does not turn off on its own. To turn it off, you need to push it (an external stimulus). And once turned off, it stays off. The positions of the switch are its states. Although it transitions from \"on\" to \"off\" state (and the other way) through a continuous path, if you leave it half way, it jumps to either \"on\" or \"off\" position. Also, if you push the switch a little bit without going all the way, it jumps back to the state where it was. Thus, \"on\" and \"off\" are the two *stable* states of the system. All the intermediate states are unstable. This is an example of a bistable mechanical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something similar can be done with chemistry. Here the states could be represented by the concentrations of chemicals. Say you have two chemicals $A$ and $B$. "
